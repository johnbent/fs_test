Experiment_management is a framework for running a series of commands (called
experiments) on the particular machine that experiment_management is running
on. It takes an input file and does a parameter sweep of all the options
given in the input file and constructs commands based on those parameters.

The basic usage for experiment_management is the following:

> run_expr.py /path/to/experiment/file

To see valid command line options, do the following:
> run_expr.py --help

Experiment_management can also be run via an rc file. Either set an
environment variable EXPRMGMTRC to the location of the rc file or create
~/.exprmgmtrc. A sample config file is provided as ./rc.sample. Please
see the comments in that file for what options can be set and what they mean.

A sample input file is located in experiments/fs_test_template.py. It is
heavily commented to help try to explain what is needed to run an experiment.
That particular template is geared toward using fs_test, but really any
application can be run through experiment_management.

At this time, experiment_management's rc file and command line parameters
accept the same input. That is, it is possible to run only off of rc
parameters, only off of command line parameters, or a combination of the two.
There are certain program defaults. These defaults can be over-ridden by
the rc parameters and/or the command line parameters. The rc parameters can be
over-ridden by the command line parameters.

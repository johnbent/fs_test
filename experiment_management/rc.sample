# experiment_management config template
#
# Each section is set apart by a line like the following:
#[Machine name]
#
# <Machine name> is what will be searched for by looking up
# MY_MPI_HOST. Then, each section can have a number of options. The following
# options are the options that experiment_management knows about (not all
# have to be specified):
#
##
## Options that affect generated commands and what is printed by 
## experiment_management.
##
#
# The command to use to run parallel programs. Default is mpirun
#runcommand=mpirun
#
# What dispatch command to use. Set to list, serial, msub or qsub. Default is
# list.
#dispatch=list
#
# How many copies of each command to dispatch. Default is 1.
#iterations=1
#
# Whether or not to shuffle the commands before dispatching them. Can be True
# or False. Default is False.
#random=False
#
# Limit how many commands can be dispatched. Default is None.
#limit=None
#
# Suppress the printing of commands. Set to True or False. Default is False.
#quiet=False
#
##
## Options that affect how commands are submitted to a dispatch system such as
## moab.
##
#
# The number of processors per node on the compute nodes. Default is None.
# Required if dispatch is not list or serial.
#ppn=4
#
# The output directory to put output in. Default is None. Required if dispatch
# is not list or serial.
#outdir=output
#
# Options to pass to the scheduler. Default is None.
#msub="-j oe"
#
# Set the walltime of dispatched commands. Set it in a way compliant with the
# dispatch system. Default is None. When set to None, the default will be left
# up to the dispatch system.
#walltime=60
#
# Whether to chain commands together or not. That is, each command will be
# dependent on the previous command  to complete before it runs. Can be set
# to True or False. Default is False.
#chain=False
#
# If commands are to be chained together, the first command can be chained to
# an existing job given by JOBID.
#lastjob=JOBID
#
# Specify a script that is to be run before each command.
#prescript=/path/to/script
#
# Specify a script that is to be run after each command.
#postscript=/path/to/script
#
# Specify the number of processors to request. This is used to calculate
# the number of nodes to request. The default is None. When set to None, the
# calculation of the number of nodes to request will be done based on the 
# generated mpi run commands.
#nprocs=None
#
#
# Here is a sample section:
#[sample]
#runcommand=aprun
#ppn=2
#outdir=output
#msub="-j oe"
#
# It is also possible to give a common section that will be searched before
# searching the section for a given machine:
#
#[expr_mgmt_common]
#outdir=output
#
# With the above example, it will not be needed to specify "outdir" in each
# machine's section. It is also possible to have the same options specified in
# both expr_mgmt_common and the machine's section. In this case, the value in
# the machine's section will be the one used. For example:
#
#[expr_mgmt_common]
#outdir=output
#
#[foo]
#outdir=bar
#
# When running on machine "foo", the outdir will be "bar"; on all other
# machines, it will be "output".
#
# It is possible to have other options besides those outlined above. However,
# those options will not be used internally by experiment_management. They can
# be used, however, in the input files passed to experiment_management by
# calling experiment_management's config_option_value function. Here is an
# example config section:
#
# [sample]
# runcommand=aprun
# ppn=2
# outdir=output
# filesystem=/path/to/directory
#
# In the input file passed to experiment_management, the filesystem option can
# be utilized by the following procedure (assuming expr_mgmt.py has been
# properly imported):
#
# fs = expr_mgmt.config_option_value("filesystem")
#
# If the config file contains that key, then fs will contain a string with
# contents "/path/to/directory". If that key is not found, then fs will be
# python's None.
#
# If additional options are entered that are True/False, please note that these
# will be converted to boolean types instead of strings. Keep this in mind
# when using them within the input file.

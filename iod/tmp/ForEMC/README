This program fails somewhere in IOD when a transaction is persisted.

Sometimes it fails when Transaction 3 (Step 0) is persisted.
Sometimes it fails when Transaction 4 (Step 1) is persisted.
I've never had it get beyond that.  I've done about 6 runs on May 21 after Jeff updated the IOD and HDF5 to current versions.

The logs in LogsFromFailedRun are from a run that failed when Transaction 4 was being persisted.
The file iod.debug.log-18817-nid00006-1400710859 in LogsFromFailedRun/IOD_LOGS contains the WTF messages about missing files 

The file LogsFromFailedRun/OUTPUT_LOG show the output from the script.  
There are some errors and messages early on that are expected and can be ignored.  
The failure corresponds to this part of the log:

Persist After Step 1 Transaction 4

-----
To reproduce the problem,  run the script vpicio.cn64-ion8-p1-s6-r1.sh found in this directory.

I run from ion1.
cd to this dir; then
./vpicio.cn64-ion8-p1-s6-r1.sh >& OUTPUT_LOG

You can monitor OUTPUT_LOG from another screen on ion0 to see progress.   
The HDF5 server & some client messages appear in files in ff_output (which is created if not already in existence)

I believe I have opened up the write permission sufficiently so you can run here.  
But, you can also copy the script and run it from anywhere.

I have a bare-bones .bashrc (see below) & do not use any setup from /scratch/iod/* or elsewhere.

There are 2 things I do that you should as well to replicate my environment:

1) I have my own .plfsrc, copied from /etc/rc into /home/ruth/.plfsrc.  It's edited to enable DEBUG level output from IOD.

2) On the IONs, you should have this in your environment:
MPICH_GNI_NDREG_LAZYMEM=disabled

Since this applications runs the ff_server on the IONs and the vpicio_uni application on the CNs, in my .bashrc I have

# .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
	. /etc/bashrc
fi

# User specific aliases and functions 

# OS-specific (ION or CN/BU-LOGIN)
if [ -f /usr/local/ff/ruth/RC_FILES/bashrc ]; then
	. /usr/local/ff/ruth/RC_FILES/bashrc
fi


The /user/local/ff/ruth/RC_FILES/bashrc on the IONs has this:
#  my per-arch .basrc defines;   This is for IONs
export MPICH_GNI_NDREG_LAZYMEM=disabled

on the CNs (and buffy) the file exists but is empty.
